By creating a clone app, companies can leverage a ready-made solution that offers features like trading in stocks, commodities, and mutual funds, as well as market analysis tools, portfolio management, and account tracking.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Angel One Master Account

To begin using Angel One for copy trading:
1. **Open the Angel One Clone App**: Ensure you have access to the Angel One app or its clone version provided by your copy trading software.
2. **Log in to Your Master Account**: Use your primary Angel One account, which will act as the "Master" account.
3. **Enable API Access**: In the app settings, find and enable API access. This feature will allow the copy trading software to link with your account and replicate trades.

## Step 2: Adding Angel One as a Child Account

To add child accounts:
1. **Login to Each Child Account**: Open the copy trading software and log in using Angel One credentials for each child account.
2. **Link with Master Account**: In the copy trading software, connect each child account with the master account to allow real-time trade replication.
3. **Configure Trade Settings**: Set parameters like lot size, stop loss, and leverage to match the child account’s requirements.

## Step 3: Testing the Setup

Once the accounts are linked:
1. **Make a Test Trade on the Master Account**: Verify that the child accounts replicate the trade automatically.
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check that trades are accurately copied across all accounts, ensuring smooth operation.
